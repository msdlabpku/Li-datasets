# Li-datasets

## Introduction
---
This project contains the datasets for training Li potential models 
in the paper "Self-Healing Mechanism of Lithium in Lithium Metal"

These datasets contain train and test datasets, and these datasets are generated by [dpgen](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dpgen) and Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). The datasets can be directly used to trian a Li potential model using [DeePMD-kit](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit)


**See DFT calculations and datasets section in [Supplementary materials](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1002%2Fadvs.202105574&file=advs3655-sup-0001-SuppMat.pdf) for more information about these datasets.**


## Files

`box.npy`  contains the lattice parameters information (one line for one configuration)

`coord.npy`  contains the coordinate information (one line for one configuration)

`energy.npy` contains the calculated energy information (one line for one configuration)

`force.npy` contains the  calculated force information (one line for one configuration)

`virial.npy` contains the calculated virial information (one line for one configuration)

`type.raw` contains elements information of each atoms for all configurations in the file 

`type_map.raw` map the elements information from the number to word
