### Li-datasets

This project contains the datasets for training Li potential models 
in the paper "Self-Healing Mechanism of Lithium in Lithium Metal"

These datasets contain train and test datasets, and these datasets are generated by dpgen (https://github.com/deepmodeling/dpgen) and Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).

See DFT calculations and datasets section in Supplementary materials for more information about these datasets

If you want to use these datasets, please cite the paper "Self-Healing Mechanism of Lithium in Lithium Metal" (https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202105574).
